🔍 Key Insights & Findings

Our analysis of the OmniMart dataset led to the following key insights:

[Insight 1]: Younger males(18-35) dominate purchases, with Electronics, Grocery, and Water driving revenue, while Pepsi leads despite moderate ratings. 

[Insight 2]: Revenue shows seasonal volatility, with strong acquisition but weaker retension, as new customers increasingly outnumber repeat ones.

[Insight 3]: High operational efficiency and positive feedback(65% + "Excellent/Good") contrast with retention challenges, despite balanced payments and fast-shipping preferences.
